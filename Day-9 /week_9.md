Part 2 of the video talks about how to store and query unstructured data such as images, text, and voice using vector databases. It covers the concepts of vector embedding, similarity search, and various tools and techniques for generating and storing embeddings.

**Highlights**:
+ [00:34:54][^3^][3] **The difference between structured and unstructured data**
    * Structured data has a predefined schema and can be stored in relational databases
    * Unstructured data has no fixed structure and includes images, text, voice, and videos
    * Most of the data in the world is unstructured and requires different methods of storage and retrieval
+ [00:36:45][^4^][4] **The limitations of relational and no SQL databases for unstructured data**
    * Relational databases require a schema and cannot perform similarity search or semantic search on unstructured data
    * No SQL databases can store unstructured data as binary objects or documents, but are not efficient or scalable for similarity search or semantic search
    * Vector databases are designed to store and query vector embeddings of unstructured data, which enable faster and more accurate similarity search and semantic search
+ [00:42:06][^5^][5] **The concept of vector embedding and the tools and techniques for generating embeddings**
    * Vector embedding is the process of converting unstructured data into numerical vectors that capture the semantic meaning and features of the data
    * There are various tools and techniques for generating embeddings, such as word2vec, Elmo, hugging face API, open AI API, etc.
    * Embeddings can be generated using pre-trained models, fine-tuning pre-trained models, or training from scratch
+ [00:51:46][^6^][6] **The use cases and benefits of vector databases for unstructured data**
    * Vector databases are used for long-term memory for llms, semantic search, similarity search, recommendation systems, etc.
    * Vector databases provide faster and more accurate retrieval and search of unstructured data based on embeddings
    * Vector databases also provide indexing, similarity score, and similarity search functions for embeddings
