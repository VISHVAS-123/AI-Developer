# Section 1: Architecting low-code ML solutions (~12% of the exam)

## 1.1 Developing ML models by using BigQuery ML. Considerations include:
###  Building the appropriate BigQuery ML model (e.g., linear and binary classification, regression, time-series, matrix factorization, boosted trees, autoencoders) based on the business problem

### Feature engineering or selection by using BigQuery ML

### Generating predictions by using BigQuery ML

## 1.2 Building AI solutions by using ML APIs. Considerations include:

### Building applications by using ML APIs (e.g., Cloud Vision API, Natural Language API, Cloud Speech API, Translation)

### Building applications by using industry-specific APIs (e.g., Document AI API, Retail API)

## 1.3 Training models by using AutoML. Considerations include:

### Preparing data for AutoML (e.g., feature selection, data labeling, Tabular Workflows on AutoML)

### Using available data (e.g., tabular, text, speech, images, videos) to train custom models

### Using AutoML for tabular data

    ●  Creating forecasting models using AutoML

    ●  Configuring and debugging trained models
